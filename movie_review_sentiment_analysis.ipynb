This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, and Jon Favreau definitely didn't disappoint.\",\n",
       " \"This film is the definition of a mixed bag. While the animation is very nice, the rehashed score is decent, and Timon and Pumbaa are very funny, I hate some stuff in this film. The film is soulless and does nothing new to justify its existence. Also, Simba, Scar, and Mufasa are all super uninteresting. However, Zazu is the absolute worst. He has so many jokes that could get laughs, but John Oliver's voice is so bland that I swear an answering machine did the voice work. The songs are also mixed. While I enjoyed Hakuna Matata and The Circle of Life, Be Prepared and a few others were complete garbage. Also, there are only 3 scenes in this 2-hour film that seemed decent to me. The stampede was decent in that it looked nice and kept the action going. The second is Timon and Pumbaa convincing Simba to believe in the meaningless line of indifference because these are self-aware animals choosing not to be self-aware. The final and best one is The Lion Sleeps Tonight. This is the funniest, catchiest, and honestly most interesting scene in the whole film. It is the only thing truly expanded upon from the original for some reason. There are some good elements to the film, but most of it is garbage.\",\n",
       " 'Lion King (2019) I felt as much as this movie looks impressive visually it misses it when it comes to hitting the emotional responses as far as comedy, sadness, or songs. The comedy was not there at all. This film skips jokes in the Original film and I never laughed. I only chuckled. This film misses the visual vibrant colors of the original film. Everything is natural pale colors. It misses it for me when it comes to the stampede scene. What this film does do is provide more drama to action scenes and context to Scar and Nola. Scar you almost feel why he is upset with why he has not come further and that his King role was taken away from him but we also see how he abused power in the Lion King more than the animated film. This film misses the emotional responses I should have like the Circle of Life or I am going to be a King. The Scar song is the one where it is the worst. The passing in this film is too quick and does not give enough time for this film to pause and breath. I did like some things like showing how Rafiki got Simba’s Hair. I thought that characters who missed it for me in this film the most were Rafiki, Zazu’s, Timon. They never hit the emotional response that I felt in the animated Lion King. Rafiki is missing his Kong Fu moves and Timon is missing the sarcasm. I do feel like the best songs in this film are the new songs during the end credits. The redone songs in this film did not hit me either. They missed the emotional response and took me out of the film. The stampede scene in this film is not as strong as the original animated film. The Animated one gives a much bigger emotional response and feels bigger in scope. The live action film feels more contained in the stampede scene. I don’t feel a sense of danger in the stampede. I was impressed seeing thin to the bones Lions in the Lion King. I think adding that Scar over hunted in this film gave it more depth because that was not clear in the animated film. The animated film made it seem like Scar scared off all the animals. ',\n",
       " 'Ugh. Talking animals. You lose a lot of the magic when you go from an exaggerated cartoon to what looks like a national geographic special with a couple people talking over the scenes adding their own dialog. That one fact could not escape me. While it is a good testament to the CGI in the film... it was totally unnecessary to remake this movie. The live action look of CGI animated animals added nothing to the legacy of the lion king and if anything, further convinces me I need not bother seeing any of the other remakes they roll out. Not a fan. Do yourself a favor and watch the original one instead.',\n",

Beyonce is just terrible an Nala all of her lines feel forced and emotionless.  Also the various amounts of \"real\" animal actions like licking and scratching while delivering dialoge were more distracting the enduring.  This one just did not hit the mark.  Go watch the original animated movie.',\n",

In their defense, there has been much worst this decade and even this year. But this is just a bland husk of the original movie. Should not be as hated as it is, but does not deserve much more than that.\",\n",
       " \"I didn't really need a remake of this. However, I can't deny that the visuals are stunning, performances solid, direction good, and I still can't watch Mufasa die. I wasn't as emotionally effected this time on the whole. Probably because I know the story but also maybe because there was something missing. I can't put my finger on it. I'm a Jon Favreau fan though.\",\n",

This \"live-action\" adaptation is just as witty and delightful as its traditionally-animated predecessor, with a likable cast, the same legendary songs, and groundbreaking visuals. Though not as refreshing and modified as some of the studio\\'s recent live-action adaptations, The Lion King is sure to satisfy any fans of the original, if not for the storytelling, then for its adorably furry protagonists.',\n",

I seen this movie once I thought that the original 94' cartoon was a bit better then this one. I will say I liked how James Earl Jones came back to do the voice over work for Simba's dad. I thought that the cgi computer animation was good, almost goes the same path as the original, same songs etc... The actors that did the voice over work did fine, but I could not place all of the actors to the characters if you will. The songs kind of fell flat in my opinion I would not pay for this movie, and it was a bit slow and a lot of small talk idk this movie was alright go watch the original instead of this one.\",\n",

His father (still James Earl Jones) gets murdered under questionable circumstances, so Simba flees the kingdom, only to later learn a life lesson and assume the responsibility he previously ran away from.  I\\'m very quickly reaching a point that I may just be skipping these movies altogether.  I\\'ve already vowed not to see these remakes in theaters so as to not inflate box office numbers, but the more I watch of these, the more I feel like I am just making extremely poor use of my time.  I\\'ll just cut to the chase: if you\\'ve seen the 1994 animated featured, you\\'ve already seen this movie as well, and you\\'ve seen it done better.  Look, I know I am sound like I am coming down harshly on this, and if I am being honest, there are worse live-action remakes from Disney.  But with each one of these releases, I get more and more burnt out, and they\\'ve dropped four of these in the same calendar year.  I get that the technology is there for it, and the special effects admittedly look great, but they\\'ve sucked the life out of this story to the point that I think this is soulless.  It adds nothing to the already existing movie other than 30 minutes to the runtime, so why make it?  Well, this made $1.6 billion worldwide, so I get the real \"why,\" but for me, there just has to be more artistic integrity.  They got Jon Favreau to direct which makes total sense because of The Jungle Book, but I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen him less inspired, and I have watched the majority of his library.  If we are getting down to brass tacks here, I think that Donald Glover is miscast as Simba.  Beyoncé is really only here to do one thing, and it feels like cheating to put James Earl Jones back in the same part. Rafiki\\'s role is so diminished that it might as well have been cut, and John Oliver is hit or miss as Zazu (for me, it\\'s mostly missing).  The only two people I think that walk away from this looking good is Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa.  They have some honestly good chemistry together, and it felt like they were actually in the same room together when they recorded their lines.  Even though they make one too many fart jokes, they were a breath of fresh air when I was all but ready to call it quits.  Even the music is a big step down for me.  No song is done better than the original, and you have Chiwetel Ejiofor totally Shatner-ing Be Prepared.  As you may expect, it\\'s just embarrassing, and you think that it might be the low point, but just you wait.  They had the gall to make Can You Feel the Love Tonight take place in the broad daylight.  It is completely nonsensical, and it makes it all the more apparent how little quality control Disney has in these live-action remakes.  I do give points to Eichner, Rogen and the visual effects, but I cannot give you a single reason to watch this over the original.',\n",

Not a complete and total copy minus a lot of the comedy that was in the original. The moments with Rafiki which I loved from the first, just fell flat in the remake.

       " \"Review:\\n‘The Lion King' is a musical-family film directed and produced by Jon Favreau. It is a photorealistic remake of Disney's traditionally animated film of the same name. \\nThis movie has a classic case of rehashing the same story scene by scene with some dialogue changed up. Sometimes it worked, but more then often it didn't. It messed with a lot of the classic things we all know and love from the original Lion King, tweaked them into something new, but in the end never really pulled it off.\\nI was really missing Jeremy Irons as Scar; Chiwetel Ejiofor just didn't bring anything to this character at all. He didn't seem menacing or scary for that matter. I remember watching the original movie and knowing that Scar is a villain that could get away with anything, and it was because of the voice acting done by Jeremy Irons. The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. Other than those two, it is a very forgettable and hollow version of the story.\\nFirst let's start off with what I liked about the movie. The CGI. It is incredible, it's mesmerising and beautiful. But that's all it is, is beautiful CGI, they've completely lost sight of the story, the emotion and the magic. There is a lot of people that complain that the animals are too realistic, so they can't capture the raw emotion of the characters like you could in the 1994 Lion King. I don't believe that to be true. You can make things lack emotion psychically because they're a realistic looking animal, but it is then the actor portraying that character's job to bring the emotion to it. Unfortunately, not a lot could pull that off in this movie.\\nOverall, this movie was one that I was really looking forward to and it let me down. The voice acting is forgettable almost as much as the story itself. I wouldn't be choosing this one over the original version to watch.\\n2.5/5\",\n",

       " \"Ah. My arch-nemesis in the form of a movie. We meet at last. This movie is a travesty. Don't watch it. I would just like to leave it at that, but I guess I'll elaborate. I guess first I will address the photo-realistic CGI elephant in the room, the animation. Not live-action, there's only one live-action shot in the entire movie. This is an animated film. And the animation is technically some of the most impressive ever put to screen. Seriously, this makes Life of Pi look like Madagascar by comparison. It was absolutely mesmerizing to watch...when the animals weren't talking. Whenever they were talking, it was awkward and laughably bad at times. What everyone has been saying is true, realistic animals cannot convey the emotions necessary for a story like this on their faces. In some scenes, I actually had trouble telling the characters apart or even understanding what was going on in the scene because of the lack of emotion on the characters' faces. That's a huge problem. I think Zazu got it the worst. Seriously, the animatronic birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room are more expressive than he is in this film! His face is frozen in a permanent frown, just like the real bird he's based on. The design does not fit the personality of the character at all. Same goes for most of the other characters. They were just off-putting. Speaking of the characters, how is the voice acting? While the film does feature a (mostly) talented cast, the dialogue in this movie is beyond awkward and the line delivery is just awful. I don't know how they possibly messed that up, but they found a way! It's very stilted and unnatural. The line delivery coupled with the characters' faces made me laugh out loud during Mufasa's death scene. Funniest shit I've seen in a movie all year. It's so bad, it's good! Look up the scene on YouTube, you'll be in for a laugh! As for the story, it's exactly the same as the original except they really nerfed the hyenas. They weren't funny and they weren't scary. They were boring. Eric André and Keegan-Michael Key are absolutely wasted in this movie. They also cut out the best song, Be Prepared, and cut most of Rafiki's interaction with Simba, the best scene! As for the comedy, it was just boring at best and absolutely obnoxious at worst. I'm not the biggest fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I'll take the originals over these guys any day! Literally all of their jokes are self-referential. Sometimes the jokes don't even make sense unless you've seen the original, which you really should not do in a remake! As for the music, the score is just as amazing as the original but the songs are pretty bad, honestly. I already did a whole post about it months ago so I'll try not to repeat myself, but they are either butchered, cut, shoehorned in, copied or copy-pasted! The new Beyoncé song especially sticks out like a sore thumb. Many of the most memorable scenes from the original are dumbed-down and heavily simplified to make them more realistic, I guess, but it just goes to show how traditional animation is the only medium this film can work in. In the 1940s, Disney was experimenting with giving the characters in Bambi a more realistic look. They decided against it and made them more stylized because the characters were not expressive enough to convey the emotions of the story. They knew doing something like this was a bad idea in the 40s! This movie is a mistake! I think that's all I have to say about this movie. It's just bad. Nothing about it works as a film. Just look up the opening scene on YouTube. That will give you just as much enjoyment as you would get from watching the whole movie. But yet again, just like Aladdin, it seems like most people disagree with me and love this movie. It's actually now the highest-grossing animated film of all-time. I can't even get angry at this movie anymore. It just makes me sad. Is this what Disney has become? What was once the company that defined the industry with their creative new takes on classic stories is now just regurgitating their old movies for profit? That just depresses me, honestly. Oh how the mighty have fallen. Oh well. At least Mulan looks kind of cool. Anyway, that's all I have to say about this POS. Don't bother, just watch the original. That's what I'm going to do, and I'm never going to think about this movie again.\",\n",

       " \"This Disney Live Action process seems to be at a crossroads with the latest release of the all time classic, The Lion King. As I have talked about numerous times on this blog as they keep making these over and over inevitably they will run out of stories. However, they are still mostly well made and entertaining so they will keep making them until the well runs dry. So people can either choose to be grumpy and think their childhood is ruined, or they can try and see if these movies breathe new life in to these timeless tales.\\n\\nThis iteration of The Lion King, directed by the great Jon Favreau, is being billed as a live action re telling of the classic Hamlet esque tale. In a different sense though it is really just better version of CGI/Animation to just make it more life like. That is why I will be doing my Animation grades for this rather than the Stock Watch etc…\\n\\nAnimation – A The visuals in this movie are truly incredible and make it seem like you are just watching Planet Earth, with a Lion King story. The only points I knock it is there are a few times when I wish I could see the emotions a bit more on some of the animals faces. Other than that the shots were all incredible, and the animals all felt super lifelike and dare we say, cute.\\n\\nVoice Cast – B- When we saw the announcement for this movie, the actors they got were a big part of the conversation. There was definitely a mixed bag though as there were some great performances and some so so ones. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa absolutely steal the show and are hysterical in every scene they were in. James Earl Jones obviously did his thing as Mufasa, and Chiwetel Ejiofor really brought a more terrifying dimension to Scar than the great Jeremy Irons.\\n\\nThe only real issues were with adult Simba and Nala who were played by Donald Glover and Beyonce (dont kill me Bey-Hive) respectively. They just did not bring the energy at all to their line readings and almost felt lifeless at times. Both sounded great singing but when they just had to talk to other characters they both felt out of place at times.\\n\\nMusic – B+ I mean its The Lion King. Elton John, Hakuna Matata you know all the songs and probably the lyrics to them. The only difference in this was they all were slightly a bit worse than the original movie, and without the magic and special effects in the animation, this loses some of the joy that made the '94 movie so special.\\n\\nStory – B Again it is The Lion King, the story is very similar to the original which is a story we have seen throughout history. I think again it is just hard sitting in the theatre knowing every scene that is going to happen. At least in Aladdin and Dumbo they made significant story and dialogue changes in order to update the story. This really was almost a shot for shot remake which obviously hurt the creativity of the overall project.\\n\\n*A couple other tidbits\\n\\n- The stampede in this movie looked eerily similar to the stampede in Jon Favreau's last Disney Reboot, The Jungle Book (Juice Rating: 88)\\n\\n- Shahadi Wright Joseph (Us) and JD McCrary (Little) were great as young Simba and Nala and made me really care for the characters all over again.\\n\\n- Again why are there only two males in the whole pride, Mufasa and Scar? \\n\\n- Is Nala Simba's Half Sister or Scar's Daughter?\\n\\n- Jon Favreau has been Disney's go to guy for over a decade now and he did it again with this one. Between Iron Man, Jungle Book, and this he has redefined movie making. This is all from the Middle Linebacker from The Replacements.\\n\\nYes in 2019 for me the Lion King still works, even if it is not quite as magical as the glorious original.\\n\\nJuice Rating:\\n84/100\",\n",

There is nothing to set it apart. It is so unneeded. There is nothing to cause the audience to wonder about what will happen. I was even able to say the next line, since it is essentially the same script. Another problem is in the CGI animals. In the animated one, the characters were able to show various facial expressions and personality.

If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it. The voice-cast were all good, especially the return of the James Earl Jones as Mufasa.

Seth\\'s recognizable chuckle fits surprisingly well with Pumbaa\\'s personality. The visuals are jaw-dropping, I don\\'t even know whether to call this an animated film, as the visuals are hyper-realistic. A bit too realistic for the character\\'s facial expressions, but when you\\'re going for realism sacrifices have to be made. As for the \"shot-for-shot\" claim, the original film has far to many iconic moments that can\\'t be ignored, both in cinematography and screenplay.

They did add a scene with the lionesses. The graphics were beautiful. I wasn't too perturbed by the voice acting and photo-realistic animals. But... I was a tiny bit bored. Most of the new jokes didn't land. Some of them did, but it wasn't enough to overcome the ennui.

This movie is almost a scene for scene shot of the original but the dialogue and the voice actors lack passion and drama. The dialogue in pivotal moments that are key to emphasizing emotion in important scenes are changed, and not in a good way, it takes a lot of the power in key scenes out of the film. Powerful moments and statements made in the original are brushed over quickly in this one. It feels rushed, you don't get the same impact as the original which is very unfortunate because this movie is very beautifully done well. It is very beautiful to watch. They should've been kept the same delivery in dialogue if they were going to do a shot for shot remake. The voice actors aren't great either, it seems off. Their performances come off as very stale, like they are reading a book. No emotion is felt at all, seems very weird, throws you out of the movie. Music isn't great either, it doesn't hit at all, seems like they just put it in their for star power. Overall its a decent movie because of its fantastic animation, which is very unfortunate because this movie had A LOT of potential, it could have been really good but Favreau and the actors fail to create anything with substantial emotion. If the director and actors did as well as the CGI creators this movie would've been a tremendous hit, but instead it completely lacks the heart and is void of the spirit  that comes from the original.\",\n",

The characters faces being true to their animal selves, could not reflect the varied emotions and feelings needed for the story, therefore a lot of the dialogue and songs seem to be slowed down to fit with the animals face. Doesn't really work though...\\nAs well as this, the cast choice is poor (seems like they were only picking based on demographic, rather than talent...) the story is poorly adapted; it's overly rushed at some points, and then dragged out by a dung beetle at other moments - just to get the runtime up from 1h 29m to 1h 58m. \\n\\nI'm very disappointed by this movie, and will not watch again.

Though I have to admit that he was still right on target and his laugh was perfection. And, B) a *far* larger complaint was how much Beyonce *ruined* \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" by over-singing it to a degree that surpassed annoying. Her other numbers were great and she can go all out, but when you\\'re in a musical number that is a scene and character based you need to take some notes from musical theater actors and take it down to a grounded level. She was hitting grace notes up and down every single phrase and it was more than distracting; we all know she can sing well. There was no need to \"prove\" it in that scene. (And frankly, there are many better female actors of color that could have filled that role more appropriately, but it is what it is.)\\nI\\'ve also heard talk that the animal weren\\'t as facially expressive as in the original - this is true, but voice-acting was more nuanced and CGI animal emotions were more subtle which honestly worked incredibly well for me.\\nAll in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this version and I don\\'t consider it anything other than a near home-run.',\n",

Despite this, it seems the (supposed) inbreeding of Simba and Nala is something Disney has yet to set straight but I suppose that might be really difficult/pointless to do as so much of the storyline revolves around that romance and so many people seem to overlook this glitch.

I would too, ordinarily, but I was quite entertained and enthralled by Disney\\'s remake of this classic. For one thing, the story material itself is so strong that any lack of originality in the story is actually welcome! With Hollywood\\'s never ending obsession with SJW politics and inserting sexuality and profanity for it\\'s own sake it is really nice that Jon Favreau decided NOT to \"update or improve\" the story! Also, having the great James Earl Jones return as Mustafa was a great choice. He, like his character has a very regal quality and timbre to his voice that is, for this roll, absolute perfection. (Although as a big Star Wars geek, I remember turning to my wife during his first encounter with Scar and asking snarkily why he just doesn\\'t Force choke him!) Dominall Gleeson and Beyonce are also wonderful and Chiwetel Ejiofor\\'s turn as Scar is as magnificently conniving and chillingly evil as one could expect. The movie is visually stunning and should look even more breathtakingly beautiful when it ones out on Disney+ with a good HDR 4K television. So, especially if you haven\\'t seen the original, see this one on a big screen with Dolby Atmos, and then watch the original at home for kicks.

If you're going to remake a classic movie, you have to give it something different, something that makes us feel like it was worth doing, and because the 1994 original was essentially a perfect movie to begin with, this remake just seemed kind of pointless.

       " 'disney did a great job of providing fresh scenes and content, while at the same time staying true to the original. pharrell williams and hanz zimmer did an amazing job with the soundtrack, the voice actors delivered great performances and the cgi on this is beautiful. this was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, and jon favreau definitely did not disappoint.',\n",
       " \"this film is the definition of a mixed bag. while the animation is very nice, the rehashed score is decent, and timon and pumbaa are very funny, i hate some stuff in this film. the film is soulless and does nothing new to justify its existence. also, simba, scar, and mufasa are all super uninteresting. however, zazu is the absolute worst. he has so many jokes that could get laughs, but john oliver's voice is so bland that i swear an answering machine did the voice work. the songs are also mixed. while i enjoyed hakuna matata and the circle of life, be prepared and a few others were complete garbage. also, there are only 3 scenes in this 2-hour film that seemed decent to me. the stampede was decent in that it looked nice and kept the action going. the second is timon and pumbaa convincing simba to believe in the meaningless line of indifference because these are self-aware animals choosing not to be self-aware. the final and best one is the lion sleeps tonight. this is the funniest, catchiest, and honestly most interesting scene in the whole film. it is the only thing truly expanded upon from the original for some reason. there are some good elements to the film, but most of it is garbage.\",\n",
       " \"lion king (2019) i felt as much as this movie looks impressive visually it misses it when it comes to hitting the emotional responses as far as comedy, sadness, or songs. the comedy was not there at all. this film skips jokes in the original film and i never laughed. i only chuckled. this film misses the visual vibrant colors of the original film. everything is natural pale colors. it misses it for me when it comes to the stampede scene. what this film does do is provide more drama to action scenes and context to scar and nola. scar you almost feel why he is upset with why he has not come further and that his king role was taken away from him but we also see how he abused power in the lion king more than the animated film. this film misses the emotional responses i should have like the circle of life or i am going to be a king. the scar song is the one where it is the worst. the passing in this film is too quick and does not give enough time for this film to pause and breath. i did like some things like showing how rafiki got simba's hair. i thought that characters who missed it for me in this film the most were rafiki, zazu's, timon. they never hit the emotional response that i felt in the animated lion king. rafiki is missing his kong fu moves and timon is missing the sarcasm. i do feel like the best songs in this film are the new songs during the end credits. the redone songs in this film did not hit me either. they missed the emotional response and took me out of the film. the stampede scene in this film is not as strong as the original animated film. the animated one gives a much bigger emotional response and feels bigger in scope. the live action film feels more contained in the stampede scene. i do not feel a sense of danger in the stampede. i was impressed seeing thin to the bones lions in the lion king. i think adding that scar over hunted in this film gave it more depth because that was not clear in the animated film. the animated film made it seem like scar scared off all the animals.\",\n",
       " 'ugh. talking animals. you lose a lot of the magic when you go from an exaggerated cartoon to what looks like a national geographic special with a couple people talking over the scenes adding their own dialog. that one fact could not escape me. while it is a good testament to the cgi in the film... it was totally unnecessary to remake this movie. the live action look of cgi animated animals added nothing to the legacy of the lion king and if anything, further convinces me i need not bother seeing any of the other remakes they roll out. not a fan. do yourself a favor and watch the original one instead.',\n",

       " 'i did not really need a remake of this. however, i cannot deny that the visuals are stunning, performances solid, direction good, and i still cannot watch mufasa die. i was not as emotionally effected this time on the whole. probably because i know the story but also maybe because there was something missing. i cannot put my finger on it. i am a jon favreau fan though.',\n",
       " 'the lion king 2019 is a shot-for-shot remake of an animated disney classic for sure, but is nevertheless heartfelt and enjoyable for all ages. this \"live-action\" adaptation is just as witty and delightful as its traditionally-animated predecessor, with a likable cast, the same legendary songs, and groundbreaking visuals. though not as refreshing and modified as some of the studio\\'s recent live-action adaptations, the lion king is sure to satisfy any fans of the original, if not for the storytelling, then for its adorably furry protagonists.',\n",
       " 'giving it a two star just for the cgi achievements. otherwise it was lack luster. real animals have way more emotion than what was shown. disappointing thinking about what it could have been.',\n",

(and frankly, there are many better female actors of color that could have filled that role more appropriately, but it is what it is.)\\ni have also heard talk that the animal were not as facially expressive as in the original - this is true, but voice-acting was more nuanced and cgi animal emotions were more subtle which honestly worked incredibly well for me.\\nall in all, i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this version and i do not consider it anything other than a near home-run.',\n",

       " 'disney did a great job of providing fresh scenes and content, while at the same time staying true to the original. pharrell williams and hanz zimmer did an amazing job with the soundtrack, the voice actors delivered great performances and the cgi on this is beautiful. this was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, and jon favreau definitely did not disappoint.',\n",
       " \"this film is the definition of a mixed bag. while the animation is very nice, the rehashed score is decent, and timon and pumbaa are very funny, i hate some stuff in this film. the film is soulless and does nothing new to justify its existence. also, simba, scar, and mufasa are all super uninteresting. however, zazu is the absolute worst. he has so many jokes that could get laughs, but john oliver's voice is so bland that i swear an answering machine did the voice work. the songs are also mixed. while i enjoyed hakuna matata and the circle of life, be prepared and a few others were complete garbage. also, there are only 3 scenes in this 2-hour film that seemed decent to me. the stampede was decent in that it looked nice and kept the action going. the second is timon and pumbaa convincing simba to believe in the meaningless line of indifference because these are self-aware animals choosing not to be self-aware. the final and best one is the lion sleeps tonight. this is the funniest, catchiest, and honestly most interesting scene in the whole film. it is the only thing truly expanded upon from the original for some reason. there are some good elements to the film, but most of it is garbage.\",\n",
       " \"lion king (2019) i felt as much as this movie looks impressive visually it misses it when it comes to hitting the emotional responses as far as comedy, sadness, or songs. the comedy was not there at all. this film skips jokes in the original film and i never laughed. i only chuckled. this film misses the visual vibrant colors of the original film. everything is natural pale colors. it misses it for me when it comes to the stampede scene. what this film does do is provide more drama to action scenes and context to scar and nola. scar you almost feel why he is upset with why he has not come further and that his king role was taken away from him but we also see how he abused power in the lion king more than the animated film. this film misses the emotional responses i should have like the circle of life or i am going to be a king. the scar song is the one where it is the worst. the passing in this film is too quick and does not give enough time for this film to pause and breath. i did like some things like showing how rafiki got simba's hair. i thought that characters who missed it for me in this film the most were rafiki, zazu's, timon. they never hit the emotional response that i felt in the animated lion king. rafiki is missing his kong fu moves and timon is missing the sarcasm. i do feel like the best songs in this film are the new songs during the end credits. the redone songs in this film did not hit me either. they missed the emotional response and took me out of the film. the stampede scene in this film is not as strong as the original animated film. the animated one gives a much bigger emotional response and feels bigger in scope. the live action film feels more contained in the stampede scene. i do not feel a sense of danger in the stampede. i was impressed seeing thin to the bones lions in the lion king. i think adding that scar over hunted in this film gave it more depth because that was not clear in the animated film. the animated film made it seem like scar scared off all the animals.\",\n",
       " 'ugh. talking animals. you lose a lot of the magic when you go from an exaggerated cartoon to what looks like a national geographic special with a couple people talking over the scenes adding their own dialog. that one fact could not escape me. while it is a good testament to the cgi in the film... it was totally unnecessary to remake this movie. the live action look of cgi animated animals added nothing to the legacy of the lion king and if anything, further convinces me i need not bother seeing any of the other remakes they roll out. not a fan. do yourself a favor and watch the original one instead.',\n",

       " \"ah. my arch-nemesis in the form of a movie. we meet at last. this movie is a travesty. do not watch it. i would just like to leave it at that, but i guess i will elaborate. i guess first i will address the photo-realistic cgi elephant in the room, the animation. not live-action, there is only one live-action shot in the entire movie. this is an animated film. and the animation is technically some of the most impressive ever put to screen. seriously, this makes life of pi look like madagascar by comparison. it was absolutely mesmerizing to watch...when the animals were not talking. whenever they were talking, it was awkward and laughably bad at times. what everyone has been saying is true, realistic animals cannot convey the emotions necessary for a story like this on their faces. in some scenes, i actually had trouble telling the characters apart or even understanding what was going on in the scene because of the lack of emotion on the characters' faces. that is a huge problem. i think zazu got it the worst. seriously, the animatronic birds in the enchanted tiki room are more expressive than he is in this film! his face is frozen in a permanent frown, just like the real bird he is based on. the design does not fit the personality of the character at all. same goes for most of the other characters. they were just off-putting. speaking of the characters, how is the voice acting? while the film does feature a (mostly) talented cast, the dialogue in this movie is beyond awkward and the line delivery is just awful. i do not know how they possibly messed that up, but they found a way! it is very stilted and unnatural. the line delivery coupled with the characters' faces made me laugh out loud during mufasa's death scene. funniest shit i have seen in a movie all year. it is so bad, it is good! look up the scene on youtube, you will be in for a laugh! as for the story, it is exactly the same as the original except they really nerfed the hyenas. they were not funny and they were not scary. they were boring. eric andré and keegan-michael key are absolutely wasted in this movie. they also cut out the best song, be prepared, and cut most of rafiki's interaction with simba, the best scene! as for the comedy, it was just boring at best and absolutely obnoxious at worst. i am not the biggest fan of timon and pumbaa, but i will take the originals over these guys any day! literally all of their jokes are self-referential. sometimes the jokes do not even make sense unless you have seen the original, which you really should not do in a remake! as for the music, the score is just as amazing as the original but the songs are pretty bad, honestly. i already did a whole post about it months ago so i will try not to repeat myself, but they are either butchered, cut, shoehorned in, copied or copy-pasted! the new beyoncé song especially sticks out like a sore thumb. many of the most memorable scenes from the original are dumbed-down and heavily simplified to make them more realistic, i guess, but it just goes to show how traditional animation is the only medium this film can work in. in the 1940s, disney was experimenting with giving the characters in bambi a more realistic look. they decided against it and made them more stylized because the characters were not expressive enough to convey the emotions of the story. they knew doing something like this was a bad idea in the 40s! this movie is a mistake! i think that is all i have to say about this movie. it is just bad. nothing about it works as a film. just look up the opening scene on youtube. that will give you just as much enjoyment as you would get from watching the whole movie. but yet again, just like aladdin, it seems like most people disagree with me and love this movie. it is actually now the highest-grossing animated film of all-time. i cannot even get angry at this movie anymore. it just makes me sad. is this what disney has become? what was once the company that defined the industry with their creative new takes on classic stories is now just regurgitating their old movies for profit? that just depresses me, honestly. oh how the mighty have fallen. oh well. at least mulan looks kind of cool. anyway, that is all i have to say about this pos. do not bother, just watch the original. that is what i am going to do, and i am never going to think about this movie again.\",\n",

       " \"this disney live action process seems to be at a crossroads with the latest release of the all time classic, the lion king. as i have talked about numerous times on this blog as they keep making these over and over inevitably they will run out of stories. however, they are still mostly well made and entertaining so they will keep making them until the well runs dry. so people can either choose to be grumpy and think their childhood is ruined, or they can try and see if these movies breathe new life in to these timeless tales.\\n\\nthis iteration of the lion king, directed by the great jon favreau, is being billed as a live action re telling of the classic hamlet esque tale. in a different sense though it is really just better version of cgi/animation to just make it more life like. that is why i will be doing my animation grades for this rather than the stock watch etc…\\n\\nanimation – a the visuals in this movie are truly incredible and make it seem like you are just watching planet earth, with a lion king story. the only points i knock it is there are a few times when i wish i could see the emotions a bit more on some of the animals faces. other than that the shots were all incredible, and the animals all felt super lifelike and dare we say, cute.\\n\\nvoice cast – b- when we saw the announcement for this movie, the actors they got were a big part of the conversation. there was definitely a mixed bag though as there were some great performances and some so so ones. billy eichner and seth rogen as timon and pumbaa absolutely steal the show and are hysterical in every scene they were in. james earl jones obviously did his thing as mufasa, and chiwetel ejiofor really brought a more terrifying dimension to scar than the great jeremy irons.\\n\\nthe only real issues were with adult simba and nala who were played by donald glover and beyonce (dont kill me bey-hive) respectively. they just did not bring the energy at all to their line readings and almost felt lifeless at times. both sounded great singing but when they just had to talk to other characters they both felt out of place at times.\\n\\nmusic – b+ i mean its the lion king. elton john, hakuna matata you know all the songs and probably the lyrics to them. the only difference in this was they all were slightly a bit worse than the original movie, and without the magic and special effects in the animation, this loses some of the joy that made the '94 movie so special.\\n\\nstory – b again it is the lion king, the story is very similar to the original which is a story we have seen throughout history. i think again it is just hard sitting in the theatre knowing every scene that is going to happen. at least in aladdin and dumbo they made significant story and dialogue changes in order to update the story. this really was almost a shot for shot remake which obviously hurt the creativity of the overall project.\\n\\n*a couple other tidbits\\n\\n- the stampede in this movie looked eerily similar to the stampede in jon favreau's last disney reboot, the jungle book (juice rating: 88)\\n\\n- shahadi wright joseph (us) and jd mccrary (little) were great as young simba and nala and made me really care for the characters all over again.\\n\\n- again why are there only two males in the whole pride, mufasa and scar? \\n\\n- is nala simba's half sister or scar's daughter?\\n\\n- jon favreau has been disney's go to guy for over a decade now and he did it again with this one. between iron man, jungle book, and this he has redefined movie making. this is all from the middle linebacker from the replacements.\\n\\nyes in 2019 for me the lion king still works, even if it is not quite as magical as the glorious original.\\n\\njuice rating:\\n84/100\",\n",

(and frankly, there are many better female actors of color that could have filled that role more appropriately, but it is what it is.)\\ni have also heard talk that the animal were not as facially expressive as in the original - this is true, but voice-acting was more nuanced and cgi animal emotions were more subtle which honestly worked incredibly well for me.\\nall in all, i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this version and i do not consider it anything other than a near home-run.',\n",
